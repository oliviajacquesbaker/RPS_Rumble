## Current Game State

As of 6/25/20, the project has been marked complete and submitted to Weekly Game Jam 154. The final project is available on [itch.io](https://mantisstudios.itch.io/rps-rumble).

To win, a player must deplete their opponent's health points to zero using the variety of attacks and abilities available to them. A player can transform into either rock, paper, or scissors at any time to use that character's specialties.

Rock has the ability to execute a ground-pound, beating the defenseless scissors. Paper folds up into a paper airplane on jumping to fly, avoiding the attacks of rock. Scissors has an extended basic attack range, so even the elusive paper can not escape.

It doesn't take many hits to bring a full health bar down, so players must be careful with how they engage. Upon a game end, players can always go for a rematch.
